@fn std::set_intersection_do(first1,last1,first2,last2,op)
@brief
	Unites all of the elements that belong to both sorted source ranges and
	do some operation on the united elements.
@arg first1
	An input iterator addressing the position of the first element in the first
	of two sorted source ranges to be united and sorted into a single range 
	representing the intersection of the two source ranges. 
@arg last1
	An input iterator addressing the position one past the last element in the 
	first of two sorted source ranges to be united and sorted into a single range
	representing the intersection of the two source ranges. 
@arg first2
	An input iterator addressing the position of the first element in second of 
	two consecutive sorted source ranges to be united and sorted into a single 
	range representing the intersection of the two source ranges. 
@arg last2
	An input iterator addressing the position one past the last element in second 
	of two consecutive sorted source ranges to be united and sorted into a single
	range representing the intersection of the two source ranges.
@arg op
	The operation which will be dealed on the united elements.
@return
	The operation.
@remark
	The sorted source ranges referenced must be valid; all pointers must be 
	dereferenceable and within each sequence the last position must be reachable 
	from the first by incrementation. 

	The sorted source ranges must each be arranged as a precondition to the application
	of the merge algorithm in accordance with the same ordering as is to be used by 
	the algorithm to sort the combined ranges.

	Being differ from std::set_intersection, the element type of the two sorted source 
	ranges can be different.

	The value types of the input iterators need be less-than comparable to be ordered,
	so that, given two elements, it may be determined either that they are equivalent 
	(in the sense that neither is less than the other) or that one is less than the 
	other. This results in an ordering between the nonequivalent elements. When there
	are equivalent elements in both source ranges, the elements in the first range 
	precede the elements from the second source range in the destination range. If the
	source ranges contain duplicates of an element, then the destination range will 
	contain the maximum number of those elements that occur in both source ranges.

	The complexity of the algorithm is linear with at most 2*((last1每first1)每(last2每first2))每1
	comparisons for nonempty source ranges.
